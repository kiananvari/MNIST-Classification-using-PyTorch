# Fashion_MNIST image classification using HMM

This project aims to classify images in the Fashion_MNIST dataset using a hidden Markov model (HMM). The Fashion_MNIST dataset consists of 10 categories of clothing images with 60,000 training samples and 10,000 testing samples. This project uses a convolutional neural network (CNN) with self-attention layers to extract features from images in the Fashion-MNIST dataset. The extracted features are then used to train 10 hidden Markov models (HMMs) for each class of clothing images. The HMMs are evaluated on the testing set using accuracy, F1-score, and AUC-ROC evaluation metrics. The project includes code for training and evaluating the HMMs, as well as a README file with installation and usage instructions.
